PRAXIS(7)                      Mutineer's Guide                      PRAXIS(7)



NAME
       praxis - a package manager for Mutiny's package API, theory

PHILOSOPHY
       Starting from the bottom-up, praxis aims to be composed of multiple
       small utilities that do one thing, so as to ease frontend development
       and more importantly, to make the surface area for issues very small.
       With this design in mind, praxis can be fast and very compact, while
       providing a lot of useful functionality for developers, metadata
       consumers, and users.

       No code evaluation is used at any point. All code is generated purely
       by following hierarchies of inheritance for actions (build scripts) and
       metadata.  Concepts like envdirs
       <https://skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-envdir.html> are used to
       additionally ease the amount of parsing that must be done to files in
       order to construct metadata for packages, repositories, and libraries.

       Furthermore, another goal is ensuring that it should be possible to get
       metadata from packages without having to call out to a shell running
       arbitrary code or duplicate metadata. This has tended to be a problem
       for other source-based package formats, such as the Arch Linux AUR,
       Exherbo’s exheres-0, and Gentoo’s EAPI.

BUGS
