.SH "NAME"
praxis \- package manager for Mutiny\(aqs package API, theory
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
This page consists of documentation and other notes on the design of the \fBpraxis\fP package manager.
.SH "PHILOSOPHY"
.sp
Starting from the bottom\-up, \fBpraxis\fP aims to be composed of multiple small utilities that do one
thing, so as to ease frontend development and more importantly, to make the surface area for issues
very small. With this design in mind, \fBpraxis\fP can be fast and very compact, while providing a lot
of useful functionality for developers, metadata consumers, and users.
.sp
No code evaluation is used at any point. All code is generated purely by following hierarchies of
inheritance for actions (build scripts) and metadata.
Concepts like \c
.URL "https://skarnet.org/software/s6/s6\-envdir.html" "envdirs" " "
are used to additionally ease
the amount of parsing that must be done to files in order to construct metadata for packages,
repositories, and libraries.
.sp
Furthermore, another goal is ensuring that it should be possible to get metadata from packages
without having to call out to a shell running arbitrary code or duplicate metadata. This has tended
to be a problem for other source\-based package formats, such as the Arch Linux AUR, Exherbo\(cqs
exheres\-0, and Gentoo\(cqs EAPI. That is to say, it should be relatively static and not actually
require a shell parser for anything other than running the actual actions that build a package.

Should packages be created by concatenation of things, which creates a mostly
self\-contained and perhaps easier\-debugged build script, or should they be parsed more
heavily by the package manager itself? This needs to be decided pretty soon since it
basically dictates the rest of the format.

Something akin to \f(CRapt\-get source\fP would be pretty nice \- we have all the metadata to do just
this anyway, since all packages are built from source.

.SH "ETYMOLOGY"
.sp
Named as such to conform with the rest of the Mutiny naming scheme. "Praxis," the word, means in the
original Greek, "action." Packages are referred to as theories, thus praxis carries out a
theory(3). \f(CRpraxis\fP is the reference implementation of the package manager used by mutiny(7).
