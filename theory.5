theory \- package API used by Mutiny
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
This document aims to explain the API available for writing packages for Mutiny. This should be
considered the definitive document to consult when writing packages, or when developing package
managers.
.SH "REPOSITORIES"
.sp
Package managers \fBmust\fP support multiple repositories. The internal prioritization of these
repositories is dictated by the [priority]. User\-facing sort (ex. when listing repositories
installed on the system) is not defined.
.sp
Repository names are alphanumeric plus \f(CR_\fP and \f(CR\-\fP.
.sp
The file and directory layout of a valid repository is as follows, \fIitalicized\fP items representing
optional items, anything else required:

.SS "Repository metadata"
.sp
Repositories \fBmust\fP have a directory in their root named \f(CRmetadata\fP.
.SS "Dependencies (optional)"
.sp
Repositories \fBmay\fP contain a file in \f(CRmetadata\fP, named \f(CRdependencies\fP. The \f(CRdependencies\fP file \fBmust\fP
contain a single repository on each line. Repositories listed in this file are repositories which the
package manager \fBmust\fP have installed prior to the installation of the repository depending on them.
The order in which they are listed is unspecified.
.sp
Any repository listed will have its \f(CRlibraries\fP directory searched when parsing package files; the order
in which they are searched is determined by the \f(CRpriority\fP value of the repository.
.sp
Do not add repositories to \f(CRdependencies\fP simply because a package in your repository depends on something
in another repository. The package manager \fBshall\fP deal with determining what repository needs to be
installed to satisfy a dependency through usage of the \c
.URL "#universe" "\f(CRuniverse\fP meta\-repository" "."
.SS "Summary"
.sp
Repositories \fBshould\fP have a summary. The summary should be a short, one\-line blurb describing the
repository\(cqs contents or objective.
.SS "Priority"
.sp
Repositories \fBmust\fP have a file within \f(CRmetadata\fP named \f(CRpriority\fP.
The \f(CRpriority\fP file \fBmust\fP contain a non\-negative integer.
.sp
The intended scheme goes like so:

Third\-party repository. (ex. A distribution user\(cqs repository.)
.RE
.SS "Packages"
.sp
Repositories \fBshould\fP contain a directory named \f(CRpackages\fP; if they do not, package managers \fBmay\fP
ignore them entirely, as there\(cqs not much use to a repository with no package.
.SS "Package specifications"
.sp
Package specifications (informally referred to as "specs") are strings which describe a package.
.sp
Specifications take on multiple permutations, because they are made up of four different parts, of
which only the name is required.
.sp

For a package spec to be valid, it \fBmust\fP match the regex

.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c

.el \{\

.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c

.el \{\

Repository is alphanumeric plus \f(CR_\fP, and \f(CR\-\fP. It must start with an alphanumeric.
.RE
.sp
All parts of a package spec are case\-sensitive.
.SS "Disambiguation"
.sp
The only strictly \fBrequired\fP part of a spec is the inclusion of the
package name. If any other part other than the name is omitted, it will
be disambiguated in order to determine what packages can satisfy the
specification given.
.sp
If more than one package matches a specification, the package manager
\fBmay\fP prompt the user in some fashion to be more specific.
.SS "Format"
.sp
\f(CRtheory0\fP files and \f(CRlib0\fP files are effectively just shell scripts. Package managers \fBshould\fP
avoid locking the user into any particular Bourne\-style shell implementation; as such, the format
of these files should adhere to shell syntax as defined in
.URL "http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/" "POSIX 2016" "."
.sp
That said, a few exceptions are made for functionality that is deemed too
useful to be given up, and isn\(cqt yet specified in POSIX...

.RE
.SH "BUILD ENVIRONMENT"
.sp
When referring to a "build environment", this document is referring to the literal shell environment
which the shell process is running in. This means it consists of things such as variables,
functions, and current working directory.
.SS "Phases"
.sp
Everything in this section is \fBrequired\fP of any package manager implementation.
.sp
"By default" refers to a package which does not define any phases or import any libraries which
define phases.
.sp
Note the difference between "not defined" and "does nothing". Packages \fBmust\fP have each phase
defined, regardless of if they have any function; if a phase listed here is not defined by either
the package manager, or the package (or a library used by the package), the package manager \fBmust\fP
error out and fail, because that is an invalid package.
.sp
"Does nothing" would mean something like \f(CRpkg_init() { true; }\fP. "Not defined" would mean no
definition of the function.
(ex. Attempting to run function that is not defined would give an unknown command error)
.SS "\f(CRpkg_init()\fP"
.sp
This phase is ran when a build environment is created for a package building session. Normally
nothing is done, and this is a dummy function.
.sp
Examples of other defintions could be creating a custom \f(CRPATH\fP and script wrappers to be used for
build systems that are stubborn to cooperate with cross\-compilation.
.SS "\f(CRsrc_fetch()\fP"
.sp
\fBOnly ran during installation.\fP
.sp
This phase\(cqs purpose is to get any sources needed to make the package being built. By default it
downloads any unretrieved files specified in the \c
.URL "#Downloads" "\f(CRDOWNLOADS\fP" " "
metadata, and then
verifies the files match the checksums specified in the \f(CRsha256sum\fP metadata.
.sp
Usually you will not need to change this.
.sp
Examples of other definitions could include retrieval of \f(CRgit\fP sources, \f(CRhg\fP, \f(CRcvs\fP, etc.
.SS "\f(CRsrc_unpack()\fP"
.sp
\fBOnly ran during installation.\fP
.sp
This phase\(cqs purpose is to unpack any files retrived during \f(CRsrc_fetch()\fP. By default this means
it will extract any archives downloaded into the [Build directory], and then change into the
[Work directory].
.sp
Examples of other definitions could include checking out \f(CRgit\fP sources into \f(CRWORK\fP, or similar.
.SS "\f(CRsrc_prepare()\fP"
.sp
\fBOnly ran during installation.\fP
.sp
This phase\(cqs purpose is to prepare the package for the real build process; so, things which are
normally done before building, like applying patches, generating Autotools scripts, etc. are to be
done here.
.sp
By default it does nothing.
.SS "\f(CRsrc_configure()\fP"
.sp
\fBOnly ran during installation.\fP
.sp
This phase\(cqs purpose is to run package configuration\-related steps of the build process. Things
like \f(CR./configure\fP, \f(CRcmake\fP, or writing build configuration files would be done here.
.sp
By default it is not defined.
.sp
The rationale behind not providing a default definition is that it allows for more flexibility and
less package manager dependent functionality. Rather than putting a default definition that, say,
expects an Autotools like package, and putting that functionality in the package manager, it can be
done with libraries.
.SS "\f(CRsrc_compile()\fP"
.sp
\fBOnly ran during installation.\fP
.sp
This phase\(cqs purpose is to run the compilation process for the package.
Things like \f(CRmake\fP, \f(CRninja\fP, etc. would be done here.
.sp
By default it is not defined.
.SS "\f(CRsrc_test()\fP"
.sp
\fBOnly ran during installation.\fP
.sp
This phase\(cqs purpose is to run tests for the package being built. Things
like \f(CRmake check\fP, \f(CRctest\fP, \f(CR./setup.py test\fP, etc. are done here.
.sp
By default it is not defined. This phase is special in that the package manager \fBshould\fP make note
of this phase not being defined. The package manager \fBshould not\fP fail when \f(CRsrc_test()\fP is
undefined; at least, not by default. Failing may be useful for quality assurance purposes.
.SS "\f(CRsrc_install()\fP"
.sp
\fBOnly ran during installation.\fP
.sp
This phase\(cqs purpose is to run the installation for the package; so, commands like
\f(CRmake install DESTDIR="${IMAGE}"\fP.
.sp
Under no circumstances should anything in this phase touch something outside the build environment.
The package manager will merge files from the package to the system, and the build process \fBmay\fP not
even have access to the system anyway, instead being built in a chroot or a sandbox of some sort.
.sp
By default it is not defined.
.SS "\f(CRpkg_premerge()\fP"
.sp
\fBOnly ran during installation.\fP
.sp
This phase\(cqs purpose is to run any commands that are required to be ran on the system itself before
the package is merged.
.sp
By default it does nothing.
.SS "\f(CRpkg_postmerge()\fP"
.sp
\fBOnly ran during installation.\fP
.sp
This phase\(cqs purpose is to run any commands that are required to be ran on the system itself after
the package is merged.
.sp
(ex. Updating icon caches, displaying important information after a major package upgrade, ...)
.sp
By default it does nothing.
.SS "Directories"
.sp
The only requirements of the directory in which a package build is executed is that it is read\-write
accessable by the package manager, and that the work directory be entirely empty before any phases
are ran.
.sp
The directories in which a build is executed are undefined. However, it is a good idea to use
something located in a good location for temporary work. A directory in \f(CR/var/tmp\fP is a good idea;
\f(CR/tmp\fP, not so much, as build directories \fBshould\fP be allowed to persist for long periods of time.
