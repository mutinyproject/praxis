== Name

praxis - reference implementation of the package manager for Mutiny

Named as such to conform with the rest of the Mutiny naming scheme. "Praxis," the word, means in the
original Greek, "action." Packages are referred to as theories, thus praxis carries out a
theory(7). `praxis` is the reference implementation of the package manager used by mutiny(7).

== Synopsis

This page consists of documentation on the design of the `praxis` package manager.

== Wishlist

* Multiple repositories
    ** Intra-repository dependencies
    ** Important levels
        *** `::primary` is the most important repository
        *** Other repositories can always depend on libraries in repositories that are more important
* Repository synchronization
    ** we might not want to have `git` in the basic system requirements
        *** Sounds like a great way to justify having `rsync` be a sysreq though... which is also
            kinda bad. that said, there is stuff like `openrsync` now...
        *** Having full history of the source repositories on your system is very appealing though
            and would be very much in line with system principles
    ** We could offer synchronization via tar archives _or_ git repositories; gitlab and github
       both can do autogenerated archives for each commit, the `master` branch, etc.
    ** Multiple ways to sync repositories
    ** Paludis has sync prefixes: `cave sync -s local repository`, which is really useful for
    development of repositories
* Something akin to `apt-get source` would be pretty nice - we have all the metadata to do just this
  anyway, since all packages are built from source
